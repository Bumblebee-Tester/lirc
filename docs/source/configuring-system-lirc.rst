Configuring System LIRC
=======================

Once you have your IR emitter or transciever hooked
up to your computer, you'll want to configure the
system installed LIRC to ensure it works for emitting
IR.

You'll also want to ensure you have a configuration
file for the remote control that you want to emulate when
emitting IR since whatever you're sending IR to may only
understand IR codes from certain remotes.
